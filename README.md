# CID

This is my graduation project for my undergradtuate Bachelors Degree in Computer Engineering

The project is a modular architecture for holistic self driving solutions for cars in simulated environments. It is an attempt to make development and testing of such solutions easier.

# Motivation
The motivation of this project comes from the fact that autonomous cars have the ability so solve a multitude of problems. They can lower the occurance of fatal on road and road side accidents, they can lower the carbon footprint of cars by driving more efficiently, and they can reduce traffic congestion by communicating with each other and not causing possible traffic blockages. Even with all these possible advantages, big companies such as google, uber, audi, bmw, have all struggled to get a working implementation into the market.

I believe that the rate of innovation and development always increases when a possible problem is open to be solved by everyone. Even if a person has the expertise to design an autonomous driving system, it is unlikely they have the resources to build and test their design. These resources are only available to giant tech companies like google and amazon.

# Goals
The goal of this project is to investigate whether it is possible to not only a build a self driving car (people have already build programs that can drive cars in a video game), but a full autonomous driving solution that can work in a simulated environment (We will be using the open world of GTA 5). Such a solution should not only be able to navigate the roads of the environment, but also make meaningful and correct decison. We will also explore if such an environment is sufficient for testing whatever novel solution for an autonmous car we make.


The latest iteration of the project is CIDv0.3
