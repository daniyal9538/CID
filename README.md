This is my graduation project for my undergradtuate Bachelors Degree in Computer Engineering

The project is an investigation into whether a publically available and easily accessible game can be used to develop and test a fully autonmous solution for cars

# Motivation
The motivation of this project comes from the fact that autonomous cars have the ability so solve a multitude of problems. They can lower the occurance of fatal on road and road side accidents, they can lower the carbon footprint of cars by driving more efficiently, and they can reduce traffic congestion by communicating with each other and not causing possible traffic blockages. Even with all these possible advantages, big companies such as google, uber, audi, bmw, have all struggled to get a working implementation into the market.

I believe that the rate of innovation and development always increases when a possible problem is open to be solved by everyone. Even if a person has the expertise to design an autonomous driving system, it is unlikely they have the resources to build and test their design. These resources are only available to giant tech companies like google and amazon.

# Goals
Hence, the goal of this project is to investigate whether it is possibel to not only a build a self driving car (people have already build programs that can drive cars in a video game), but a full autonomous driving solution that can work in a simulated environment (We will be using the open world of GTA 5). Such a solution should not only be able to navigate the roads of the environment, but also make meaningful and correct decison. We will also explore if such an environment is sufficient for testing whatever novel solution for an autonmous car we make.
The focus is to not make the best most amazing self driving solution ever, but to prove that it is possible to do so within a game, and it is possible to carry out meaningful testing in the game. Essentially, this project is a case study for our hypothesis.

As this is an ongoing research project, I will not be allowed to post all the code into this repository, but  i will post what i can. Some of the code might not yet be fully finished.

For further insight into the project, please read the pdf file in this repository, it holds the initial design and inital work done on this project
