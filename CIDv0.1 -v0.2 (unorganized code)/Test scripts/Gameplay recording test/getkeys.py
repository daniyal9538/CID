#program is needed as a backend library to capture keystrokes
#python has an inbuilt library for this purpose (pyautogui), 
# but it is not suitable as it only records keystroke when there is a change in input
#this program continuosly monitors input from the key state, and generates an interupt when it asynchronously detects a key is pressed
